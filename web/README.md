## server

This is the server that determines which client should render which frame and layer. This server also handles the stitching of frames uploaded by the client.

It also allows for posting base64 encoded PNG image data for saving images on the server. Images will be saved in /uploads. Example:

```
var data = document.getElementById('canvas').toDataURL("image/png");
fetch('http://localhost:3000/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        data: data,
        filename: 'filename.png',
    })
})
```
